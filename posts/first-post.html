      <h1>Hello World - Starting My Blog Journey</h1>
      
      <p>Welcome to my personal blog! I'm excited to finally have a space to share my thoughts, document my projects, and connect with others in the developer community.</p>
      
      <h2>Why Start a Blog?</h2>
      <p>I've been working on various projects and learning new technologies, and I realized that writing about these experiences could be valuable both for myself and for others. A blog gives me a place to:</p>
      
      <ul style="margin: 1rem 0 1rem 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
        <li>Document my learning journey</li>
        <li>Share solutions to problems I've encountered</li>
        <li>Showcase projects I'm working on</li>
        <li>Connect with other developers</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>What to Expect</h2>
      <p>I'll be writing about web development, game development, and various programming topics. I'm particularly interested in creating interactive experiences and building tools that make development easier.</p>
      
      <p>This blog itself is hosted on GitHub Pages, keeping things simple and focused on content. No complex frameworks or build processes - just clean HTML, CSS, and the occasional JavaScript when needed.</p>
      
      <h2>Let's Connect</h2>
      <p>If you're interested in following along, feel free to check out my <a href="https://github.com/KylerQZ" target="_blank">GitHub profile</a> where I share my code and projects.</p>
      
      <p>Thanks for reading, and stay tuned for more posts!</p>

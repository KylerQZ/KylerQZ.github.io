      <h1>My Game Collection - Building Browser Games</h1>
      
      <p>I'm excited to share my collection of browser-based games! Over the past few months, I've been developing various games using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Each game has been a learning experience and a chance to experiment with different game mechanics and design patterns.</p>
      
      <h2>The Games</h2>
      
      <h3>🎯 2048</h3>
      <p>A classic sliding puzzle game with a sleek black and gold theme. Combine tiles to reach 2048! Features smooth animations, touch controls for mobile, and local storage for saving your best score. The game uses CSS transforms for buttery-smooth tile movements and includes keyboard and swipe controls.</p>
      
      <h3>❓ Quiz Game</h3>
      <p>Test your knowledge with this interactive quiz game! Features multiple difficulty levels, a clean user interface, and instant feedback on your answers. Built with vanilla JavaScript and styled with a modern black and gold aesthetic to match the site's theme.</p>
      
      <h3>⚔️ Warzone Survival</h3>
      <p>An intense 3D combat survival game built with Three.js! Defend your base against waves of enemies, build defensive walls, upgrade your base, and recruit teammates. Features include:</p>
      <ul style="margin: 1rem 0 1rem 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
        <li>First-person shooter mechanics with realistic weapon handling</li>
        <li>Base building system with multiple wall types</li>
        <li>Wave-based enemy spawning with increasing difficulty</li>
        <li>Shop system for buying ammo, medicine, and teammates</li>
        <li>AI teammates that help defend your base</li>
        <li>Dynamic minimap showing enemy positions</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>🏃 Parkour Challenge</h3>
      <p>A fast-paced platformer where timing and precision are key. Jump across platforms, avoid obstacles, and reach the finish line as quickly as possible. Perfect for quick gaming sessions!</p>
      
      <h3>🕵️ Hide and Seek</h3>
      <p>A unique twist on the classic game, implemented as a browser game with clever AI opponents. Can you find all the hidden objects before time runs out?</p>
      
      <h3>🛡️ Nexus Defense 2067</h3>
      <p>A futuristic tower defense game set in the year 2067. Strategically place defensive structures to protect your nexus from waves of attackers. Features multiple tower types, upgrade systems, and challenging enemy AI.</p>
      
      <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
      <p>All games share a consistent black and gold color scheme, creating a cohesive visual identity across the collection. I focused on:</p>
      <ul style="margin: 1rem 0 1rem 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
        <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Optimized code for smooth 60 FPS gameplay</li>
        <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Clear controls and intuitive UI design</li>
        <li><strong>Responsiveness:</strong> Games work on both desktop and mobile devices</li>
        <li><strong>Polish:</strong> Attention to detail in animations and visual feedback</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Technical Stack</h2>
      <p>The games are built using modern web technologies:</p>
      <ul style="margin: 1rem 0 1rem 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
        <li><strong>Three.js</strong> for 3D graphics in Warzone Survival</li>
        <li><strong>Canvas API</strong> for 2D rendering and game loops</li>
        <li><strong>CSS3</strong> for animations and transitions</li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla JavaScript</strong> for game logic and state management</li>
        <li><strong>LocalStorage</strong> for saving game progress and high scores</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Try Them Out!</h2>
      <p>All games are completely free to play and run directly in your browser - no downloads or installations required. Head over to the <a href="../games.html">Games page</a> to start playing!</p>
      
      <p>I'm constantly working on improvements and new features, so check back regularly for updates. If you have any feedback or suggestions, feel free to reach out through my <a href="https://github.com/KylerQZ" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
      
      <h2>What's Next?</h2>
      <p>I'm already planning new games and features for the existing ones. Some ideas I'm exploring include multiplayer capabilities, more advanced AI systems, and even more game genres. Stay tuned!</p>
